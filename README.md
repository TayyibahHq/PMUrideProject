# PMUrideProject
PmuRide is a ride-sharing app for PMU students where they can request rides and drivers can accept and 
complete those requests. This project could involve features like GPS tracking, payment processing, and 
driver rating systems, and building a user interface for both riders and drivers. PmuRide can help reduce 
traffic congestion by promoting carpooling and reducing the number of individual cars on the road. This 
can also lead to less time spent searching for parking spots.
